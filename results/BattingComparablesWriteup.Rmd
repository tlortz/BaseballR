I'm setting out to experiment with various methods of predicting future performance of baseball players, given their age, positon and history. I will also compare the relative performance of these methods. This little project is totally indebted to the Lahman Baseball Database, available at http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/. 

# Creating a database of historical batting statistics and player characteristics
## Reading in raw statistics

## Creating a MonetSQLite database and connecting to it

## Inserting raw statistics into the new database

## Inserting player info into the db from master and fielding tables

# Enriching batter information with player age and position
## Manipulate fielding table to create a lookup of primary position for each player
